	Requirements:

	Create 3 slices to represent the appointment schedule, where each slice contains 
	client name (string), time (string), and duration (int) respectively.
	Write code to add a new appointment.
	Write code to cancel an appointment by client name.
	Write code to list allÂ appointments.
